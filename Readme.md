✅ **What is Spec-Kit Plus?** 

Spec-Kit Plus is a modern AI-assisted framework that helps developers work in a structured way with coding agents like Copilot, Claude Code, or Gemini. It uses the SDD-RI method (Specification-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence), which means you clearly define rules, requirements, and architecture before AI writes the code.

It follows the Two-Output Philosophy: every feature must produce working code and reusable intelligence (like documentation, reasoning, or patterns). This makes AI-generated code more reliable, consistent, and aligned with project standards, while improving long-term collaboration between humans and AI.

➡️ 1. **Constitution Phase – Set the project rules first**

In this phase, you define all the important project rules before writing any code. This includes coding standards, architecture decisions, naming conventions, and quality requirements. These rules act like a “constitution” that both developers and AI agents must follow throughout the project.

➡️ 2. **Specify Phase – Describe what the feature should do**

Here you write clear, structured requirements for each feature. You explain what the feature must achieve, how it should behave, and what the user expects. This becomes the main guide for the AI when generating the code.

➡️ 3. **Clarify Phase – Remove confusion and fill in missing details**

After writing the initial requirements, you refine them. You clear up any vague statements, answer open questions, and make sure nothing is missing. This ensures the AI has a complete and accurate understanding of the feature before starting development.

➡️ 4. **Plan & Tasks Phase – Decide how to build and break it into steps**

In this step, you convert the clear requirements into a technical plan. You choose the tools, libraries, and structure needed to build the feature. Then the work is broken into small, well-defined tasks, making it easy for developers and AI agents to implement.

➡️ 5. **Implement Phase – Generate code and reusable intelligence**

Finally, the AI produces the actual working code based on the plan and requirements. At the same time, it also creates reusable intelligence such as explanations, patterns, or documentation. This phase ensures that every feature results in both solid code and helpful knowledge for future development.
