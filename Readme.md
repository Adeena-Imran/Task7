✅ **What is Spec-Kit Plus?** 

Spec-Kit Plus is a modern AI-assisted framework that helps developers work in a structured way with coding agents like Copilot, Claude Code, or Gemini. It uses the SDD-RI method (Specification-Driven Development with Reusable Intelligence), which means you clearly define rules, requirements, and architecture before AI writes the code.

It follows the Two-Output Philosophy: every feature must produce working code and reusable intelligence (like documentation, reasoning, or patterns). This makes AI-generated code more reliable, consistent, and aligned with project standards, while improving long-term collaboration between humans and AI.
